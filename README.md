# NEMSA TESTER

This is a test taker app I built for the Nigerian Electricity Management Service Agency.

## Features

1. A firestore backend
2. A React JS front end
3. Has a timer whose expiry date is retrieved from the firestore backend <code>onComponentDidMount(){}</code>
4. An admin only access page that has the statics of all test takers along with a dynamic histogram designed using chartJS
5. So much more.

### ENJOY :)
